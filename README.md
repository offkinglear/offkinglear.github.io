The movie "Butterfly Effect" (2004). There is a scene where father tries to kill son, as the son possesses the ability to change future present from going into past. Father recognizes that ability in his son, since he himself has that ability.
The movie X-Men (2000). The actual world is more advanced in everything. Take thunder commanders.
The team frigerator_mom is going to put 21 stories in front of you right here, which outperform any movie released before 2020.
